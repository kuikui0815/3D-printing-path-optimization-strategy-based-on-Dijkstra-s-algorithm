# 3D-printing-path-optimization-strategy-based-on-Dijkstra-s-algorithm

With the expeditious evolution of 3D printing technology, there is a growing need to improve its efficiency and quality. In the context of 3D printing of concrete in architectural applications, conventional slicing software, originally devised for PLA materials, has proved inadequate in tackling issues such as accumulation, gaps, and backfilling.

This project presents a 3D printing path optimization strategy that utilizes the Dijkstra algorithm for architects in Rhino and Grasshopper environments. This approach provides the flexibility to adjust path direction and layers freely, and reduces sedimentation problems without the need for support materials.

To validate the effectiveness of the system, we conducted tests on four typical 3D printing tasks. The results show that compared to the Cura system, the optimisation rates of the system for the four task types were 23.21%, 57.14%, 50% and 40% respectively. The average response time for the four types of 3D printing tasks was approximately 0.1211 seconds. Additionally, it enhances the interaction between architects and 3D printing devices, which is currently lacking in the field. The proposed method offers greater possibilities and customization for the application of 3D printing in construction
